This repo contains a small quasar/vue based application built for Reyen Court.

Default data is stored locally as an array and a vue-directive is used to iterate over the data objects to generate
and display 'info cards'. Most of the styling is done through components provided by the Quasar framework.

A live version of the app can be found at https://pacific-woodland-21935.herokuapp.com/#/

Thanks for taking a look! if you have any suggestions please feel free to leave a comment.
